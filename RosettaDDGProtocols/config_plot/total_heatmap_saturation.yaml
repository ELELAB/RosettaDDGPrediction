# Configuration file for plotting a heatmap containing the total
# ΔΔG scores for positions on which a saturation mutagenesis scan
# was performed. 

# Positions will be displayed on the x-axis, while
# residue types included in the saturation mutagenesis will be
# displayed on the y-axis. 

# Cells corresponding to positions for which a mutation to a 
# particular residue type was not performed (partial scan) will
# be either blank or masked (aesthetics for the mask can be defined
# in the 'nancells' section of the configuration).


# version of the configuration file
version: 1
