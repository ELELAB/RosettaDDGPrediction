# Configuration file needed to run the `cartddg` protocol with
# the `ref2015_cart` scoring function.


# version of the configuration file
version: 1


#--------------------- GENERAL PROTOCOL OPTIONS ----------------------#


# family the protocol belongs to
family: cartddg


#------------------------ PDB-RELATED OPTIONS ------------------------#


pdb:
  # whether PDB files containing multiple chains are allowed
  # (false for cartddg protocols since they are used to predict
  # the ΔΔG of stability of monomeric proteins)
  allow_multi_chains: False
  # whether PDB files with chain IDs missing are allowed
  # (true for cartddg protocols since chain IDs are not necessary,
  # because they only deal with monomeric proteins)
  allow_no_chain_ids: True


#--------------------- MUTATIONS-RELATED OPTIONS ---------------------#


# options regarding how mutations are defined in the mutations list
# file
mutations:
  # which kind of residue numbering is used in defining mutations
  # ("pose" for cartddg protocols since the 'mutfile' format used
  # by them requires residue numbering to be consistent with the
  # Rosetta pose numbering)
  resnumbering: pose
  # extra data associated with each mutation. For cartddg protocols,
  # there are no extra data.
  extra: !!null
  # number of structures to be generated for each mutation. It is
  # set to 'null' for cartddg protocols since they do generate 
  # multiple structures but the option must be given as a
  # Rosetta option (see -ddg:iterations below).
  nstruct: !!null

# options regarding saturation mutagenesis scans
saturation:
  # file mapping the names of the directories that will contain
  # data for the mutations to the mutations themselves as specified
  # in the mutations' list file. Will be written at the end of
  # the run.
