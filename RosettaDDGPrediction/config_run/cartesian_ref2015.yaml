# Configuration file needed to run the `cartesian` step of the 
# `cartddg` protocol with the `ref2015_cart` scoring function.


# version of the configuration file
version: 1


#--------------------- GENERAL PROTOCOL OPTIONS ----------------------#


# family the protocol belongs to
family: cartddg


#------------------------ PDB-RELATED OPTIONS ------------------------#


pdb:
  # whether PDB files containing multiple chains are allowed
  # (false for cartddg protocols since they are used to predict
  # the ΔΔG of stability of monomeric proteins)
  allow_multi_chains: False
  # whether PDB files with chain IDs missing are allowed
  # (true for cartddg protocols since chain IDs are not necessary,
  # because they only deal with monomeric proteins)
  allow_no_chain_ids: True


#--------------------- MUTATIONS-RELATED OPTIONS ---------------------#


# options regarding how mutations are defined in the mutations list
# file
mutations:
  # which kind of residue numbering is used in defining mutations
  # ("pose" for cartddg protocols since the 'mutfile' format used
  # by them requires residue numbering to be consistent with the
  # Rosetta pose numbering)
  resnumbering: pose
  # extra data associated with each mutation. For cartddg protocols,
  # there are no extra data.
  extra: !!null
  # number of structures to be generated for each mutation. It is
  # set to 'null' for cartddg protocols since they do generate 
  # multiple structures but the option must be given as a
  # Rosetta option (see -ddg:iterations below).
  nstruct: !!null

# options regarding saturation mutagenesis scans
saturation:
  # file mapping the names of the directories that will contain
  # data for the mutations to the mutations themselves as specified
  # in the mutations' list file. Will be written at the end of
  # the run.
  d2mfile: dirnames2mutations.txt


#--------------------------- PROTOCOL STEPS --------------------------#


steps:
  # third step of the cartddg protocol
  cartesian:
    # name of the working directory where the step will be run
    wd: cartesian
    # name of the flags file(s) that will be written and used
    # to run the step
    flagsfile: flags.txt
    # name of the Rosetta output file(s) that will be written
    output: cartesian.out
    # Rosetta options to be used in conjunction with the Rosetta
    # executable  
    options:

      #------------------------ Input options ------------------------#
      
      # whether to ignore unrecognized residues found in the PDB
      -in:ignore_unrecognized_res: True
      # whether the PDB file will be read as a full-atom structure
      # as opposed to coarse-grained (should not be changed)
      -in:file:fullatom: True

      #------------------- Tracing/logging options -------------------#

      # logging level. 300 is INFO level.
      -out:level: 300
      # whether to add the tracer channel name to the output
      -out:chname: True
      # whether to add a timestamp to the tracer channel name
      -out:chtimestamp: True
      # whether to save modelling times for each model in seconds
      -out:save_times: True

      #------------------------- Run options -------------------------#

      # whether to use checkpointing
      -run:checkpoint: True
      # whether to write out detailed version info, if it was 
      # available at compile time
      -run:version: true

      #----------------------- Packing options -----------------------#

      # file containing extra residue types to be included in the
      # packing palette. 'null' if no file is specified (you can
      # also comment out the option).
      -packing:packer_palette:extra_base_type_file: !!null

      #------------------------- DDG options -------------------------#

      # whether to toggle on Cartesian mode
      -ddg:cartesian: true
      # number of iterations of refinement
      -ddg:iterations: 3
      # how many (sequence) neighbors should be included in the 
      # backbone minimization (Rosetta default is 1)
      -ddg:bbnbrs: 1
      # whether or not to dump repacked wild-type and mutant pdbs
      -ddg:dump_pdbs: true
      # name of the mutfile specifying the mutation
      -ddg:mut_file: mutation.mutfile
      # output file of predicted ΔΔGs
      -ddg:out: mutation.ddg

      #------------------ Scoring function options -------------------#

      # how far does the FA pair potential go out to
      -score:fa_max_dis: 9.0
      # scoring function weights
      -score:weights: ref2015_cart
