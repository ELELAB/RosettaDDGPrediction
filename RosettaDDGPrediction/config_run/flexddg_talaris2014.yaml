# Configuration file needed to run the `flexddg` protocol with
# the `talaris2014` scoring function.
#
# The protocol was originally developed by Kortemme Lab [barlow2018]_
# and a slightly modified version of the original XML file containing
# the core of the protocol is available in the RosettaDDGProtocols
# package under `rosetta_scripts/Flex_ddG.xml`.

version: 1


#--------------------- GENERAL PROTOCOL OPTIONS ----------------------#


# family the protocol belongs to
family: flexddg


#------------------------ PDB-RELATED OPTIONS ------------------------#


pdb:
  # whether PDB files containing multiple chains are allowed
  # (true for flexddg protocols since they are used to predict
  # the ΔΔG of binding)
  allow_multi_chains: true
  # whether PDB files with chain IDs missing are allowed
  # (false for flexddg protocols since chain IDs are needed to
  # discriminate between chains)
  allow_no_chain_ids: false


#--------------------- MUTATIONS-RELATED OPTIONS ---------------------#


# options regarding how mutations are defined in the mutations list
# file
mutations:
  # which kind of residue numbering is used in defining mutations
  # ("pdb" for flexddg protocols since the 'resfile' format used
  # by them requires residue numbering to be consistent with the
  # input PDB numbering)
  resnumbering: "pdb"
  # extra data associated with each mutation. For flexddg protocols,
  # the "_chaintomove_" attribute is defined to identify what chain(s)
  # will be moved away from the interface when computing the free
  # energy of the single chains.
  extra: !!seq ["_chaintomove_"]
  # number of structures to be generated for each mutation
  nstruct: 35

# options regarding saturation mutagenesis scans
saturation:
  # file mapping the names of the directories that will contain
  # data for the mutations to the mutations themselves as specified
  # in the mutations' list file
  d2mfile: dirnames2mutations.txt


#--------------------------- PROTOCOL STEPS --------------------------#


steps:
  
  # flexddg protocols consist in only one step
  flexddg:
    # name of the working directory where the step will be run
    wd: "flexddg"
    # name of the flag file(s) that will be written and used
    # to run the step
    flagsfile: "flags.txt"
    # name of the Rosetta output file(s) that will be written
    output: "flexddg.out"
    # Rosetta options to be used in conjunction with the Rosetta
    # executable
    options:
      
      #------------------------ Input options ------------------------#
      
      # whether to ignore unrecognized residues found in the PDB
      -in:ignore_unrecognized_res: True

      # as opposed to coarse-grained (should not be changed)

      # available at compile time
