# Configuration file needed to run the `relax` step of the
# `cartddg2020` protocol with the `ref2015_cart` scoring function.


# version of the configuration file
version: 1


#--------------------- GENERAL PROTOCOL OPTIONS ----------------------#


# family the protocol belongs to
family: cartddg2020


#------------------------ PDB-RELATED OPTIONS ------------------------#


pdb:
  # whether PDB files containing multiple chains are allowed
  # (false for cartddg protocols since they are used to predict
  # the ΔΔG of stability of monomeric proteins)
  allow_multi_chains: False
  # whether PDB files with chain IDs missing are allowed
  # (true for cartddg protocols since chain IDs are not necessary,
  # because they only deal with monomeric proteins)
  allow_no_chain_ids: True


#--------------------------- PROTOCOL STEPS --------------------------#


steps:
  # first step of the cartddg protocol
  relax2020:
    # name of the working directory where the step will be run
    wd: relax
    # whether (and how) to remove unnecessary files at the end
    # of the run
    cleanlevel: !!null
    # name of the flags file(s) that will be written and used
    # to run the step
    flagsfile: flags.txt
    # name of the Rosetta log file(s) that will be written
    output: relax.out
    # Rosetta options to be used in conjunction with the Rosetta
    # executable
    options:
      
      #------------------------ Input options ------------------------#
      
      # whether to ignore unrecognized residues found in the PDB
      -in:ignore_unrecognized_res: True
      # whether the PDB file will be read as a full-atom structure
      # as opposed to coarse-grained (should not be changed)
      -in:file:fullatom: True

      #------------------------ Output options -----------------------#

      # prefix for output structures' names
      -out:prefix: relax_
      # file containing the scores (will be written in the
      # directory where the step is run if no path is specified)
      -out:file:scorefile: scorefile.sc
      # score file format (should not be changed since for now
      # only text score files are parsed correctly. Rosetta default
      # is 'text'.)
      -out:file:scorefile_format: text

      #------------------- Tracing/logging options -------------------#

      # logging level. 300 is INFO level.
      -out:level: 300
      # whether to add tracer channel name to the output
      -out:chname: True
      # whether to add a timestamp to tracer channel name
      -out:chtimestamp: True
      # save modelling times for each model in seconds
      -out:save_times: True

      #------------------------- Run options -------------------------#

      # whether to turn on/off checkpointing
      -run:checkpoint: True
      # whether to write out detailed version info, if it was 
      # available at compile time
      -run:version: True
      # whether to discard coordinates information for missing density
      # atoms (whose occupancy is zero) defined in the input structure
      -run:ignore_zero_occupancy: False

      #------------------- RosettaScripts options --------------------#

      # protocol XML file
      -parser:protocol: "Cartddg2020_relax.xml"
      # variable substitutions for the XML parser, in the form
      # of name=value
